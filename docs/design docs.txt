INPUT
1. input items into input chest
2. turtle scans items
3. turtle updates internal database
4. turtle approves transfer and moves items to storage

OUTPUT
Each item must be assigned to a node, direction, and signal strength integer.

A wireless rednet signal will be sent to the node containing the item with the
direction and signal strength

The node will then output an analog redstone signal for a brief moment,
outputting the item.

This means that the internal database must also contain node, direction,
and signal strength data.

CONFIGURATION
A plaintext configuration file will contain the ID's of each computer. A 
helper program will also exist which adds nodes and database entries with
direction and signal strength information.

HARDWARE
Each node must be it's own computer. Nodes will be stored in an array.
A turtle will do the scanning and network between the controller and nodes.
The controller will be responsible for displaying tabular data and internal
record keeping.

FILES
The controller will keep a plaintext configuration file with networking information
The controller will keep serialized database data for read/write operations
The controller will have a config helper program that adds records and nodes
The controller will have a display program that displays tabular data
The controller will keep a plaintext log file that contains input and output.
The controller will have an interface for outputting items.
The turtle will have a basic scan send and push program
The nodes will have a basic listener that activates redstone signals.
